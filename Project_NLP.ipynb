Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era \\\"Cold Mountain,\\\" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Ren\\u00e9e Zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />Then again, calling Cold Mountain\\\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \\\"Glory\\\" director Edward Zwick shame. However, \\\"Cold Mountain\\\" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />\\\"Cold Mountain\\\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Ren\\u00e9e Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.<br /><br />Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern \\\"lawman,\\\" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by \\\"the war of Northern aggression,\\\" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Make no mistake, \\\"Cold Mountain\\\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.\",\n          \"Back in 1994, I had a really lengthy vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.<br /><br />I didn't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was hooked instantly. I had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.<br /><br />After my long vacation, I used to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours just to catch Personal FX.<br /><br />I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />It never did! Personal FX was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still sore.<br /><br />Way to go, FX.\",\n          \"This film contain far too much meaningless violence. Too much shooting and blood.

Alas, the movie is talky, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects.

I really feel myself in the 50's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like.

For me this is a pleasant surprise because I can't tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died I cried so hard My dad had to turn away from the show. What to you expect of a kid at age 12.

              "One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.    1\n",
              "Ahh, nuthin' like cheesy, explopitative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror...This one stars Jaqueline Lovell(sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile starlet also seen in \"Femalien\", \"The Erotic House of Wax\", and that family favorite \"Nude Bowling Party\". She is now a fixture in Surrender Cinema's line-up of talentless cuties starring in pointless, soft-porn exploitation flicks. \"Head of the Family\" actually tries to be a real moovie. A con-man and a tramp try to get said-tramp's husband off-ed. They turn to a large-brained evil genius in a wheelchair, and his family of moronic misfits, who uses mind control to send out zombies to do his nefarious bidding. Said-genius has a giant head, hence the clever title of the film: that's about the extent of the film's humor. But basically, it's an excuse to show off the ample talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina). Laced with some of the wierdest dialogue can be herd (what the heck is \"plowing oats\", anycow??), and just plain stupid, this titular thriller will moost likey appeal to the breast-cownters of Drive-In Theater, but no one else. The MooCow says avoid the devoid, unless yer looking for a rent on cheesy T&A/horror night. :=8P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
              "Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one dashing Sean Connery. The incident comes during 1904 as Theodore Roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. Needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the United States, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the Sultan of Morocco, \"Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.\"<br /><br />But in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was in reality one Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and dilettante playboy. In fact Perdicaris gave up his American citizenship years ago and was back as a Greek national. Never mind that though, his predicament was serviceable enough at the time.<br /><br />The damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it's a widow woman and her two kids that are in harm's way here. Of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our European powers to get their foothold into Morocco. The intrigues get far beyond one brigand's demand for ransom.<br /><br />The Wind and the Lion is hardly history. But it is an enjoyable film and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits my conception of Theodore Roosevelt and the scenes in the Roosevelt White House do ring true to all the stories told. John Huston plays the ever patient Secretary of State John Hay who Roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor William McKinley.<br /><br />But kids don't use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the Theodore Roosevelt era.                                                                                                      1\n",

I want to see them as soon as possible again.<br /><br />I have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen.<br /><br />I'm french and didn't know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski \"three colors : white\"... Now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting.<br /><br />i saw \"before sunset\" (the sequel in Paris) a few days before i saw \"before sunrise\" and their is no matter. They are both masterpieces. proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English which i m trying to best.<br /><br />Franck in France                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
              "I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it. The acting was awful, and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes. The acting was awful at best. Tim Roth did an OK job as did Liam Neeson, but I've no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking.<br /><br />The plot line was good, but the execution was just poor. I'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films. Braveheart was even worse though, which is this films only saving grace. But seriously, people didn't speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they'd like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts. However, if you are thinking of buying the DVD, I'd say spend your money on something else, like a better film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

              "I just got this video used and I was watching it last night. The acting started out extremely bad (hey------hey------twister) but got very good soon after wards. The tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too. The story was very well written, and it's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old \"disaster formulas\" movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years.<br /><br />While this movie had a very weird mix of FX and acting quality, this merits an A in my book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
              "DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not there. Yet, he preys on the weakest amidst the populace. The imagery and cinematography are superb, and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer.

It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance (support?) for the wars U.S. is still fighting today. I do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. I really feel myself in the 50's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like.

They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.</th>\n",

They turn to a large-brained evil genius in a wheelchair, and his family of moronic misfits, who uses mind control to send out zombies to do his nefarious bidding. Said-genius has a giant head, hence the clever title of the film: that's about the extent of the film's humor. But basically, it's an excuse to show off the ample talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina).

              "      <th>Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one dashing Sean Connery. The incident comes during 1904 as Theodore Roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. Needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the United States, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the Sultan of Morocco, \"Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was in reality one Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and dilettante playboy. In fact Perdicaris gave up his American citizenship years ago and was back as a Greek national. Never mind that though, his predicament was serviceable enough at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it's a widow woman and her two kids that are in harm's way here. Of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our European powers to get their foothold into Morocco. The intrigues get far beyond one brigand's demand for ransom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wind and the Lion is hardly history. But it is an enjoyable film and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits my conception of Theodore Roosevelt and the scenes in the Roosevelt White House do ring true to all the stories told. John Huston plays the ever patient Secretary of State John Hay who Roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor William McKinley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But kids don't use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the Theodore Roosevelt era.</th>\n",

The acting was awful at best.

I'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films. Braveheart was even worse though, which is this films only saving grace. But seriously, people didn't speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they'd like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts.

It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance (support?) for the wars U.S. is still fighting today. I do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. I really feel myself in the 50's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like. The same propaganda movies were produced that time, only with the exception that those were black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the \"U.S. wars are cool\" genre, you surely have much better movies to choose from.</th>\n",

              " 'from the film s first shot keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen s subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing rooms but a sort of u certificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p p is not about passion sexual tension or love it s about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored so that the bennets house was a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance orgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots particularly in this film to function was completely erased subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances it was so obviously trying to be a serious film the humour which is pride prejudice both austen s methodology and her appeal was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily pride prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it you can t lose jane austen s technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clear sighted keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine elizabeth s wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody s follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with what a lot of giggling and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits and where the great strength of austen s elizabeth at least in austen s eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety knightley s elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by matthew macfayden donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie as the only two sensible people in a world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen delivered with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache',\n",

committed to whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but we re all different made of different clay as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though and maybe that s the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one gets committed and obsession in committed starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name is joline and this is her story admittedly joline has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general she s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson it s forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl and days into the marriage he s gone off to find himself and figure it all out when joline realizes he s not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe it s because of that clay she s made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does in el paso texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his space and not even letting him know she s there she considers carl as being in a spiritual coma and it s her job to keep a spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia velazquez a waitress at one of the local eateries carmen s grampy alfonso arau who is something of a mystic t bo mark ruffalo a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her for joline it s a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself there s a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from joline s point of view as krueger makes us privy to joline s thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling there s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters and the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it was imperative that joline be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely it s all a part of the character she creates there s an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out she s a likable agreeable person and because you ve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is it s a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life as carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth she is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal and as with joline this character is well written and velazquez brings her convincingly to life overall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson casey affleck as joline s brother jay goran visnjic alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable character the supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny clea du vall mimi summer phoenix meg art alexakis new york car thief dylan baker carl s

to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn t sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesn t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing mind you the version on the dvd is the director s cut or in this case let s salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut scenes from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are minutes into it and we still don t know what s going on or why we re watching what s going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone s death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings there s no catalyst in this story one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music it s no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment i ll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julie s mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending bird s eye view of julie running towards hudson s plane is another wink at sound of music the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence i m like what happened here the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where s peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that s one slow moving train there the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film stars but it s effect is diminished considerably because it s repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man s land is ok even if it s bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like she s on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie she s no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute how bad is darling lili even after years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release',\n",

              " 'such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar s a bug s life we re immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer when it s in the right hands that is a bug s life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions it is only pixar s second animated feature the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film after all it s a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug s life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you ll probably ever encounter not only are they all entirely amiable and likable there isn t an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters but they re colourful they re eclectic and they re idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug s life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season s harvest with his antics the problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack s hands however it s a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in flik s mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony s rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers if you think about it a bug s life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line s of akira kurosawa s classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bug s life the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who s in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it s exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie collectively as i ve said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bug s life even better is that the film isn t restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film the clichéd kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we d like however it s easy to ignore this fault and it s incredulously easy to enjoy this film although a bug s life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that they re not just a one hit wonder but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards it s only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bug s life other than see it it s not quite the best which we ve seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year and i ll be damned if this isn t the best animated feature of',\n",

the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealed i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die don t get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett s name judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was a momentous period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys can t stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda s death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wan s death okay but yoda s not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not heroes against a legion of stormtroopers don t believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando s base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missed as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star the last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father s face because it made it complete by annakin s revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact that s is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke s father isn t that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but i can not know for sure let s see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was i am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading bottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately',\n",
              " 'crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman s agreement which it beat to theatres by a few months it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying it s because i m jewish isn t it it s much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical somewhat shamefully the brief featurette on the warners dvd doesn t mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti semitic one but it s interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish there s little doubt in sam levene s performance that the character is in fact also gay not a mincing caricature but there s definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper s confused soldier there s not much of a mystery to who the murderer is even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy there s an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry but the atmosphere is pure rko noir set over one long sweltering night the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script a laid back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum robert young s maigret like detective gloria grahame s tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties but the lasting impression is of robert ryan s excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row a big surprise hit in as a reward dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac which itself had a notable tendency to target jews so much for crusading',\n",

on my nes etc now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only years old at the time of writing this review i because of my s style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn t see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunk s adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as the world david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later at a local café the chipmunks are playing a game of around the world in days against the chipettes brittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile alvin get s in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team s likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive a dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the kick ass music pardon my french p my favorite song is without a shred of doubt the girls and boys of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped it s also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include getting lucky kind of suggestive for a kid s film eh and my mother as well as wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky i first didn t think anything of it but when i grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince s men when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it s one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the ending is of course a happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yells alvin and the screen fades to black classic ending by the way i hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you haven t seen this flick give it a watch it s worth the money this nostalgic classic from the s gets a solid out of headin for the top don t you know we never stop believing now',\n",
